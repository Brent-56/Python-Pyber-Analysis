# Python-Pyber-Analysis
### Overview

The purpose of this data analysis is to identify ride sharing metrics/trends based on city type. Once this is complete we will were tasked with creating a  representation of the total weekly fares and based on the city types. This representation will help improve accesibility to ride sharing services and determine ride affordability for each type by providing a clear picture as to what challenges people from different city types may be facing and what solutions we can implement to mitigate the challenges our customers are facing




The first step in this process is to load and read all CSVs that will be involved in the analysis process. Here we read "city_data.csv" and "ride_data.csv"
